## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, you don't need to run any script. You just need to open the index.html file and run a server.

You can run a server in your desktop with "Live Server" extension in Visual Code.

## Contributions

My goal is to keep creating more applications to keep practicing. Please let
me know if you have any feedback.

That said, if you find a bug, please do open an issue!
